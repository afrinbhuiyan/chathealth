## ✅ Notes

- The implementation follows the Figma design where applicable. If a UI element (e.g., a sidebar or toggle) was not present in the Figma file, it was not added unless required.
- Chat logic (real-time messaging, backend, AI integration) was not requested and is not implemented. This repo demonstrates UI fidelity and responsiveness using Next.js, TypeScript, and Shadcn.
- Mobile chat layout decisions were implemented based on best-practice responsive patterns.
